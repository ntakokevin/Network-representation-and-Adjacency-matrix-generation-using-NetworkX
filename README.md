# Network-representation-and-Adjacency-matrix-generation-using-NetworkX

This project focuses on leveraging the NetworkX library to analyze and represent graphs using adjacency matrices and link lists. The main objectives of the project are as follows:

1- Construct the adjacency matrix and link lists for a given network.\n
2- Calculate the average clustering coefficient of the network using NetworkX.
3- Investigate the impact of switching node labels on the adjacency matrix and link list representations.
4- Identify the limitations of inferring certain information from the link list representation compared to the adjacency matrix.
5- Determine the number of paths of length 3 starting from node 1 and ending at node 3.
6- Count the number of cycles of length 4 in the network.
7- Examine a bipartite network and perform various analyses using NetworkX.
8- Construct the adjacency matrix and explain why it forms a block-diagonal matrix.
9- Generate adjacency matrices for the two projections of the bipartite network (on green and red nodes).
10- Calculate the average degree of the green nodes and the average degree of the red nodes in the bipartite network.
11- Compare the average degrees in each of the two network projections and analyze any differences observed.

Through this project, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of graph analysis, explore different representations of networks, and draw insights from the provided datasets using NetworkX and associated techniques.
